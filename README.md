# Rancher Cluster Provisioning Example

This repository illustrates custom cluster provisioning via Rancher Extensions without requiring
Node Drivers.

This is work in progress.

## To use

You currently need to use a fork of Rancher Dashboard that contains a few enhancements required for this
example to work.

Clone the fork of dashboard and branch.

```
cd shell
yarn link
```

```
yarn install
yarn link @rancher/shell
```
